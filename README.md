# Automated Digispark Payload for Guest Admin Creation

## Overview
This repository contains a Digispark BadUSB payload designed to create a hidden guest administrator account on Windows machines. The script executes commands to add a new user with administrative privileges while modifying system settings to maintain stealth and persistence.

## Features
- Creates a new administrator account using `net user` and `net localgroup` commands.
- Hides the account from the login screen by modifying registry values.
- Ensures persistence by adding scheduled tasks and adjusting local group policies.
- Executes stealthily to avoid detection by basic security measures.

## Prerequisites
- A **Digispark ATTiny85** microcontroller
- **Windows 10/11** target machine
- Digispark-compatible **Arduino IDE** with **DigiKeyboard** library installed

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the payload script.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/varun2864/Digispark-GuestAdmin-Payload.git
   cd Digispark-GuestAdmin-Payload

2. Open the script in the Arduino IDE and upload it to the Digispark device.
3. Insert the Digispark into the target machineâ€™s USB port.
4. The payload will automatically execute and create the hidden admin account.

To detect and remove the hidden guest admin account, run: net user GuestAdmin /delete
reg delete "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList" /v GuestAdmin /f
schtasks /delete /tn "SystemUpdate" /f
